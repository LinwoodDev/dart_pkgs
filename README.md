## Inter-Package Graph

Below are direct internal dependencies (only showing notable links):

  dart_leap[dart_leap]
  lw_file_system_api[lw_file_system_api]
  material_leap --> dart_leap
  material_leap --> lw_file_system_api
  lw_file_system --> lw_file_system_api
  localizer[localizer]
  flutter_localizer --> localizer
```

Keep commit refs for these pairs synchronized with the versions declared in each package's pubspec.yaml.
